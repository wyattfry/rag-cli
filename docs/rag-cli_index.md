## rag-cli index

Index documents for RAG

### Synopsis

Index documents by chunking them, generating embeddings, and storing them in the vector database.
This enables the AI to use these documents as context for responses and improves the quality
of AI-generated answers by providing relevant background information.

The indexing process:
1. Scans files in the specified directory (or current directory if none specified)
2. Chunks large documents into manageable pieces (default: 1000 chars with 200 char overlap)
3. Generates embeddings for each chunk using the configured embedding model
4. Stores chunks and embeddings in ChromaDB for fast semantic search

Supported file formats: txt, md, go, py, js, ts, json, yaml, yml (configurable)

EXAMPLES:
  # Index current directory (non-recursive)
  rag-cli index

  # Index specific directory recursively
  rag-cli index -r /path/to/docs

  # Index with specific file formats
  rag-cli index -f txt,md,go /path/to/project

  # Index documentation recursively with multiple formats
  rag-cli index -r -f md,txt,rst ~/projects/my-docs

```
rag-cli index [path] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -f, --formats strings   Comma-separated list of file extensions to index (without dots) (default [txt,md,go,py,js,ts,json,yaml,yml])
  -h, --help              help for index
  -r, --recursive         Index directories recursively, including all subdirectories
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```

      --debug           Enable debug mode with detailed logging
```
