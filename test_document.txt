This is a test document for the RAG CLI system.

The RAG CLI is a command-line tool that provides AI-powered assistance using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with local language models.

Key features include:
- Document indexing with chunking and embedding generation
- Vector database integration with Chroma
- Command execution capabilities
- Interactive chat functionality
- Support for multiple file formats

The system works by:
1. Reading documents from the file system
2. Chunking them into smaller pieces
3. Generating embeddings for each chunk
4. Storing the embeddings in a vector database
5. Using the embeddings for context-aware responses

This allows the AI to have access to up-to-date information from your documents and codebase.
